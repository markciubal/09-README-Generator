## Description
README-o-Matic is a README generator based on the inquirer package.

When prompted for various data points, README-o-Matic effectively and efficiently places this information in a README file so that you can get on with your day. Now, you can spend your free time on coding, or anything else you love to do. 

This application was meant to satisfy the following user story:

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
✅ THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
✅ THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
✅ THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
✅ THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
✅ THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
✅  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
